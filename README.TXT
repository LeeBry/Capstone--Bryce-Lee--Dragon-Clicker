PROJECT TITLE: Dragon Hunt
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a clicker game with music, and sprites added to it.
VERSION or DATE: 4/27/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Bryce Lee
TO START GAME:
1. Go to ButtonClicker, and initialize the void main method.
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Click the attack button to deal damage to the boss.
2. Once the boss dies, the kill count will be increased, and you can collect by clicking the collect button
3. Earn enough gold to level up, and increase your damage. ( 1+ level = Your damage+1) 
4. This game has no end yet, so it is a endless clicker game.

OVERVIEW OF CAPSTONE:
It is a simple clicker game, with a limited amount of sprites, however coding this project took
more than expected. This process of coding this game allowed me to understand how a simple game could
have complex code to do the simplest actions, as it needs to talk to multiple classes to get information
in order to execute its methods.

CONCEPTS WITHIN THE CAPSTONE:
This capstone includes many different concept that were learned throughout the year of AP Computer Science.
This capstone includes how a user interacts with a program, graphics, actionlisteners, and multiple classes.
This capstone also included various concepts outside the learning environment, such as
implementing music to a program and making it loop, dealing with unused packages in AP Computer Science,
and use of different type such as IconImage, and AudioClip.
